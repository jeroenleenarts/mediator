<p>Besides my day job I also undertake some other related activities. I regularly speak on an internal platform of my employer. I have coached several students towards their graduation. I went to a couple of conferences and spoke at a few too.</p>
<p>Of special note are the following activities:</p>
<h2>June 20th 2013 - CocoaHeads.nl meetup</h2>
<p>I organized and hosted the CocoaHeads.nl June meetup. At the meetup I also presented about my experiences during the WWDC 2013.</p>
<h2>June 2013 - WWDC 2013</h2>
<p>Me and two colleagues of mine went to the WWDC 2013 in San Francisco CA.</p>
<h2>June 4th 2013 - XebiCon 2013</h2>
<p>Presented a session titled: <a href="http://www.xebicon.nl/workshops/reanimate-your-users-on-ios">Reanimate your users.</a> Abstract: "Working on several mobile projects, Jeroen has learned that there is always a lot of work to be done when it comes to the polishing of a Mobile App. In Jeroen’s opinion, a lot of these Apps are not up to the level of quality (end-)users expect these days. Correct and useful functionality is of the utmost importance. But even a correct, useful and non-crashing app can fail miserably if you do not “polish it”. Even for usually dull business applications like corporate and banking Apps. In this session, Jeroen will give you his definition of “polish” and explain why he thinks this is important. Jeroen will wrap up by giving you some pointers to show you how easy it is to actually start polishing you iOS app."</p>
<h2>March 14th 2013 - mdevcon 2013 - tutorial session</h2>
<p>Abstract of the 4 hour tutorial session: " iOS features lots of automatic animations you get for free.</p>
<p>But to really make your app sing you need to do some extra work. Making animations too visible or disruptive only annoys people. The key is to delight your users with subtle touches.</p>
<p>In this tutorial I will help you on your way with adding animations to your iOS applications. After an initial overview and some pointers I will help everyone to get started on creating animations in their applications.</p>
<p>Bring your code if you would like some hands-on help!</p>
<p>Note: Attendees are expected to bring their own laptop running OSX Lion or higher and have XCode installed. For testing on an actual device, bringing an iPhone or iPad is recommended, but not required."</p>
