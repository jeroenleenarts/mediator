<p><img src="/assets/kop.jpg" id="image7" alt="My big head." style="float: left; margin-right: 5px" /> I'm Jeroen a dutch software developer employed by a consulting company. Mostly I write Java code. But since 2005 I have grown an interest in OSX development. I won't go into the tiniest details of software development. Most likely I'll post my personal views about my work and life as a software developer.</p>
