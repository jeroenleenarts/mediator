<p>On this page you will find some info about my project experiences. Some details have been left out because of privacy considerations.</p>
<p><small>Last updated in July 2014</small></p>
<h2>June 2014 - ongoing</h2>
<p><small>iOS, Xcode, crypto, Scala</small><br />
Switched to the ING Commercial Banking branch as a iOS security specialist.</p>
<h2>Februari 2012 - June 2014</h2>
<p><small>iOS, Xcode, REST</small><br />
Worked on the best banking app on the Dutch market at the ING Netherlands. On this project I was one of size iOS developers working on the iOS version of the ING banking app. All work was done in an agile workflow and encompased all aspects of a senior engineer on a software development project.</p>
<h2>February 2012</h2>
<p>Start at Xebia.</p>
<h2>April 2011 - December 2011</h2>
<p><small>ANT, IBM RTC, Eclipse, Oracle WebLogic 11g</small><br />
Back once again at the Nederlandse Spoorwegen(NS, Dutch Railways) with the role of software integrator on the Eclipse based planning application project. Unfortunately further details can still not be disclosed at this time.</p>
<h2>October 2010 - April 2011</h2>
<p><small>Objective-C, XCode, iOS SDK, REST, .NET, Core-Plot</small><br />
Developed an iPad application for the Info Support Professional Development Center. The goal of this application was to provide a visual representation of the key points of interest of various in-house software development projects. The iPad application presents a portable, visual representation of the status/health of a software development project.</p>
<h2>October 2010</h2>
<p><small>Objective-C, XCode, iOS SDK, REST, .NET, Core-Plot</small><br />
For a customer in the finance market a proof of concept was developed. This effort had very strict constraints on allotted time and budget. Ultimately the proof of concept was a success but the project did not proceed due to being out-bid by a competitor.</p>
<h2>September 2010 - October 2010</h2>
<p><small>Eclipse RCP, GEF, J2EE</small></p>
<p>Back for the second time on the same project at the Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS, Dutch Railways). For their Eclipse Rich Client based application the team I part of was tasked with the rebuilding of certain dynamic diagrams. This involved Eclipse RCP and GEF based development.</p>
<h2>March 2009 - September 2010</h2>
<p><small>EJB3, JBOSS, JSF, JasperReports, SOA</small></p>
<p>The MITS Company requested my help for the implementation of a billing system to help further automate their financial processing of customers. The system looked simple enough to implement on first thought, but because of specific business needs a lot of flexibility needed to be added. The goal of this project was to implement a system enabling the business to generate invoices to customers based on the services and data transfer volumes. The customers themselves mostly operate by buying the services from MITS wholesale and then reselling these to their respective clientele. Due to this structure invoices are created for each customer based on the clientele services by the customer of the MITS company.</p>
<p>With the MITS Billing project I took part in the implementation of the system. Besides my technical expertise as a software developer I was tasked with providing guidance to several junior employees. The architect of the system is based on the current architectural recommendation written by my employer InfoSupport.</p>
<h2>Oktober 2007 - March 2009</h2>
<p><small>Eclipse RCP, XML, XML Schema, XSLT, WebSphere</small></p>
<p>For the vtsPN (a company responsible for the implementation and exploitation of IT solutions for the Dutch police services) I have been involved with the maintenance of one of their broker applications. The application deals with investigative data from various national and international sources. The application implements an XML SOAP based interface to front-end applications. Through this SOAP interface front-end applications are able to request data from the various non-unified back-end systems in a unified data format. To maintain this application a workbench application was built and maintained. By importing the back-end service definitions the workbench application was able to allow the generation of the broker configurations after receiving user input on how to map the back-end services.</p>
<p>On this project I was responsible for the maintenance of the workbench product. The workbench product was an Eclipse RCP based application. I also was the technical reference concerning all matters related to XML Schema and XSLT. I was also responsible for the upgrading of the application from WebSphere 5.1 to WebSphere 6.0.</p>
<h2>July 2007 - September 2007</h2>
<p><small>JasperReports, Java 6, Swing</small></p>
<p>At a small company located in Zwijndrecht I was involved with the building of reports within their current development version of their cost engineering application. The work involved interpreting functional requirements into a working report. The application is to be used by large corporation involved with large proces industry (e.g. oil, farmaceutical).</p>
<h2>January 2007 - June 2007</h2>
<p><small>Maven 2, Java, J2EE, Python, WebSphere, Ant</small></p>
<p>At the ING Netherlands a software development project was migrated from the existing Ant based build scripts to a Maven 2 based build script. The objective was to display a convincing case study to support a ING wide introduction of Maven 2 based build scripting. The existing Ant and new Maven 2 scripting both extensively use Python scripting. Most applications are to be deployed to IBM WebSphere application servers.</p>
<p>The project is currently ongoing and based on the above paragraph no conclusions whatsoever should be made.</p>
<h2>January 2005 - December 2006</h2>
<p><small>RUP, UML, J2EE, Eclipse RCP</small></p>
<p>At the Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS, Dutch Railway) an Application was developed involving the Eclipse Rich Client Platform. The application should enable all users of the dutch rail infrastructure to plan all Dutch railway movements more efficiently. The planning involves infrastructure, material and personnel for all trains on the Dutch railway network, this includes all passenger and freight trains.</p>
<p>Further details can not be disclosed at this time.</p>
<h2>September 2004 - December 2004</h2>
<p><small>RUP, UML, J2EE Web components, Model Driven Architecture.</small></p>
<p>For the Dutch police services an application had to be developed called PSO2. PSO stands for "Politie Suite Opsporing" which basically means "Police Investigation Suite". The goal of the project was to build a supporting application for police related investigation of the Dutch Police and the Criminal Investigations Department. In this process a number of information sources were available within the Dutch police network that had to be disclosed and be made accessible via a web based front-end. One of the systems PSO2 would connect to was Everest (see my previous project experiences).</p>
<p>In this project I fulfilled the role of developer. My tasks included developing and maintaining a JSP tag library. There were also a number of maintenance related activities on a number of framework components which was based on the OMG Model Drive Architecture principles. Areas of work included expanding the event handling mechanism and building audit logging facilities into the event mechanism.</p>
<h2>June 2004</h2>
<p><small>RUP, UML, functional design, Oracle 9 Portal, Java.</small></p>
<p>For the rebuild of an existing application there were no functional specifications available. To make sure that a realistic offer could be developed by a number of contractors, the system owner tasked me and a colleague to make a rough analysis of the majority of the functionality of the system. This basically involved analysing the existing implementation. The application involved serves about 200.000 users. The users are Dutch companies. Every company in the Netherlands has to deduct certain taxes of of the wages of their employees. The system provides this information to a majority of all Dutch companies. All tax rates are based on a number of variables which depend on the work performed by the companies. The companies can access their "personal" tax rates through this system. The current implementation was based on Oracle 9i Portal Server.</p>
<h2>February 2004 - April 2004</h2>
<p><small>J2ee, Struts, Websphere 5, Junit, XML, XML schema, XSLT, JSP</small></p>
<p>In this project I was a Java developer in the web client team of the Everest Application. Activities involved implementing gui functionality in the the Struts based web interface. The web application uses Struts Tiles. These Tiles contain the presentation as JSP snippets.</p>
<p>The Everest program contained a number of projects to improve the Dutch Police information infrastructure. The goal of the program was to develop a central nation wide information system containing Dutch, European and worldwide warrant information. The system should be available to all authorised Dutch parties involved in criminal investigation.</p>
<h2>July 2003</h2>
<p><small>J2EE, Struts, WebSphere Application Developer 5</small></p>
<p>Internal training program to improve existing knowledge of IBM WebSphere 4 towards IBM WebSPhere 5. Part of the program was a 3 week long development trial on building J2EE applications, The web part of the application was based on Apache Struts.</p>
<h2>April 2003 - June 2003</h2>
<p><small>IIS5 server met ASP.NET, RUP &amp; C#, architecture</small></p>
<p>Developer on an in-house developed CRM package. Co-author of the architectural documentation. In the elaboration phase of the project several standardised components were developed and tested. A auto build environment was also implemented based on nAnt.</p>
<h2>March 2003</h2>
<p><small>Windows 2000 server, IIS5 server met ASP.NET, Jakarta JMeter, Microsoft web stress tool</small></p>
<p>Implementing and executing a http stress tests on a web application. Several dynamic application pages and webservices (SOAP over http) had to be tested for performance.</p>
<h2>January 2003 - February 2003</h2>
<p><small>ASP.NET/C#, Visual Studio .NET</small></p>
<p>The application developed in the period of February 2002 - June 2002 was ported to Microsoft .NET. This involved a complete re write of all code. In this project the developers were given free hand concerning the implementation of the system.</p>
<p>In this project elements of extreme programming were used. The planning was based on a set date given by the developers. All functionality was set in stone.</p>
<h2>September 2002 - December 2002</h2>
<p><small>.NET</small></p>
<p>Introduction into Microsoft .NET. A lot of time and effort was invested into getting to understand .NET. Several small scale implementation were developed to exercise the theory. The end result was a MCAD for .NET certification.</p>
<h2>February 2002 - June 2002</h2>
<p><small>DSDM, IBM WebSphere 4.0, Visual Age for Java, WSAD 4, JUnit</small></p>
<p>Implementing a virtual lunch room. This was a two man project. The project resulted into a fully documented and production ready application. Co-workers are now able to order lunch from their desk from the local lunch room.</p>
