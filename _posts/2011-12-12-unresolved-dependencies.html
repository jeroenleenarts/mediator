<p>A while ago I created this picture:</p>
<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="/assets/unresolved_dependencies.jpg" alt="unresolved_dependencies.jpg" title="unresolved_dependencies.jpg" border="0" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>For some reason I was watching my older pictures and this one struck a chord with me today. Since my last blog post a lot of things have happened. One of those things is that after nine years I will be leaving my current employer Info Support.</p>
<p>Also I've been doing a lot of soul searching and I have come to some conclusions.</p>
<p>There is a person I care about fighting as I write this to get well again. I sure hope that person will find the strength and will to press on and fight for all the good things this person still wants to do.</p>
<p>Suffice to say there are many other things as wellâ€¦ All coming down to the line clearly readable on this picture.</p>
