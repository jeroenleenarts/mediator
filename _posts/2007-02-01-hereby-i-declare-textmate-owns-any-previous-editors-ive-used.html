<p><img id="image147" src="/assets/textmateicon.png" alt="TextMate Icon" style="float: left; margin: 5px" /> At my current project I started using <a href="http://www.macromates.com/">TextMate</a> for real. Because I'm editing file all over the place now instead of just java code. Anyway I could say I really love feature x or y. But no, I'm actually complaining a bit. What I would like to have is a Maven 2 Bundle for TextMate. Validated editing of pom.xml files would be great and running Maven 2 projects from textmate would really improve my workflow. I guess I'll have to look into rolling my own Maven 2 bundle. A task which still seems a bit daunting. Because of all the XML validating and all. But then again, how hard can it be? Lots of Bundles to look into for examples anyway.</p>
<p>For all you potential Vista users, TextMate is Mac only. So forget Vista and get a Mac. ;)</p>
<p>Why I want maven 2? I'm doing a lot of Maven 2 edting for my curren t client right now. We are running a pilot on a project right now and when that succeeds and the business side of the equasion agrees: Loads of Maven 2 configurations to write. Not a few, not a dozen. But all together nearly one hundred poms to write. So editor support is actually almost a must.</p>
