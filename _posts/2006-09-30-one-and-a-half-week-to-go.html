I hope you all registered again for another edition of the NL-JUG&#8217;s J-Fall. Looking at the program, I must say they&#8217;re still on the right track towards becoming a must see for all Dutch Java developers.</p>
<p>Also, make sure to visit my presentation of you are attending. I won&#8217;t tell you any more details right now. But it will be a presentation which you will find a bit different in a good way. I have one of the last slots of the day, but that&#8217;s just another reason to attend my presentation. Because I will do my best to keep you interested and awake. It would be a shame to doze off during the last round of presentations. &#8220;Because of the free beer and all that is.&#8221; :P Also, to my colleagues not attending the J-Fall, don&#8217;t despair, on the 25th I will do the same presentation on our fortnightly ISKA gathering.</p>
<p>Now about my presentation&#8230; I can&#8217;t resist. Here&#8217;s a little peak-a-boo: <a href="http://blog.leenarts.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/frontpage_infosupport_slidedeck.jpg">Frontpage InfoSupport Slidedeck</a></p>
