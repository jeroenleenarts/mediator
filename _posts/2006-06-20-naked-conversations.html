<p>You blog?<br />
You read this.</p>
<p>This book was recommended to me and it was definatly worth the read. Very insightfully written and full of examples on how the mechanisms of bloggin work according to Robert Scoble and Shel Israel.</p>
<p>Basicly it's a crash course into company blogging. The reasons to do it are explained, the effects of blogging compared to traditional media and marketing. And the do's and don'ts of corporate blogging.</p>
<p>I could elaborate on how much I liked this book, it comes down to the fact that this is one of the few books I'd absolutely recommend <b>if</b> you have anything to do with blogging.</p>
<p>For more details on the book, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=naked+conversations">do a google search</a> or check a site like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=jeroenleenart-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=047174719X%2526tag=jeroenleenart-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/047174719X%25253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82" title="View product details at Amazon">Amazon</a>.</p>
<p>I'm actually thinking of doing an in-company presentation based on this book. Just to evangalize blogging a bit. The do's and don'ts are set forth in this books are true indeed.</p>
