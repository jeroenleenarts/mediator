<p><a href="http://adi.atosoriginblog.nl/weblogger/31/">Jeroen Benckhuijsen</a> has this oddly called session about implementing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">a certain language</a> on top of the Java VM. He's telling a bit about <a href="http://code.google.com/p/brainfuck4j/">implementing a custom language</a> using pure byte code.</p>
<p>He's using an interesting approach. Weird slides with a funny story. </p>
<p>It's a technical talk about the how class files are laid out and how they work with the Java memory model. It's a lot <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bcel/">info</a> <a href="http://cglib.sourceforge.net/">available</a> on the <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jvms/second_edition/html/VMSpecTOC.doc.html">web</a>. So I'll shut up now. I'll post links later.</p>
