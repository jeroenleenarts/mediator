<p>Two weeks ago I started at my new employer. Xebia. I've been busy, but soon, I will be super busy. If all goes well I'll be doing some very cool work in the near future. For now, I'm helping out colleagues where I can. Trying to make a name for myself and stake my claim within the Mobile group of Xebia.</p>
<p>Suffice to say, let's make things ripple this year. :) I took the plunge and sofar, the water has been very comfy.</p>
<p>Also, Happy valentine's day to everyone and one person in particular. :)<br />
