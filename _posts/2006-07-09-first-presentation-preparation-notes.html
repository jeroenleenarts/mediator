<p>Two days ago I thumbed through Naked Conversations again and jotted down some quick notes on what I would like to cover in my presentation. I also thought about what graphic depictions/metaphors to use.</p>
<p><!--more--><br />
Here are the notes, depictions are bracketed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Souls - Borg - Microsoft<br />(Borg Cube, 7of9 nine)<br /><em>Page 9</em>
<ul>
<li>People not borg</li>
<li>Souls of the borg

</ul>
</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>What is a blog?

<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Skype<br />(logo, friendly gal/guy with a headset)</li>

<li>Example more like InfoSupport?<br /><em>See page 63</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>As you can see this is still very rough data. But it's a start. If there's anyone with an opinion out there based on these simple notes, please let me know. At this stage the more discussion the better. I've tried to pick the most interesting aspects for my audience. The hard part will be to mold this diverse selection into one story and at the same time "make it my own". Regurgitating a book is something any drone can do. Also it's hard sometimes to decide what to include and what to scrap.</p>
