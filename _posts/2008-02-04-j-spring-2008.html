<p><img src="/assets/nljug.gif" alt="NL-Jug member" border="0" style="float: left; margin: 4px;" />Last things I heard, the NL-Jug team is hard at work preparing the next J-Spring scheduled for april 16th. I've entered a session proposal. I'm hoping they'll think my proposal is an interesting one. Right now I'll keep the details to myself, but hopefully there is more to come.</p>
<p>Also of note is that the conference's by the NL-Jug are getting more popular every time.</p>
