<p>"Ghee whiz... That was taking mighty long" I thought, "Why has my PowerBook been compiling and compiling for over 30 hours now?"</p>
<p>Then I remembered the command I entered to upgrade all installed MacPorts. I should have used <b>installed</b> instead of all. *Sigh!* I've just deleted my entire MacPorts install because I think it's easier for me to actually just reinstall the few MacPorts I use.</p>
<p>MacPorts is a toolset for Mac OSX which allows you to get loads of unix tools ready and ported for the Mac OSX operating system. It's a bit geeky, but it sure beats having to install everything by hand and hope you didn't miss a mac specific patch.</p>
