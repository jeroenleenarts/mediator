<p>Oh boy, the call for papers is in already for the <a href="http://www.nljug.org/pages/events/content/jspring_2009/">J-Spring 2009</a>. What to do??</p>
<p>I was planning doing a presentation there. But at the moment, I haven't got a clue what to talk about. I could do a follow-up of my ANTLR presentation of last year. People really liked that talk and I would like to address the few complaints I did get. (Mainly about getting a more real life example) But I doubt that'll make it past <a href="http://blogs.infosupport.com/berte/archive/2006/09/11/Behind-the-scenes_3A00_-J_2D00_Fall-Session-Selection-Committee.aspx">the selection committee</a>. Maven is something I'm not that fond of nowadays. I could do a session about neural networks in Java. But it would be nice if I actually had done some work on those in the last few months.</p>
<p>Perhaps my colleagues at work have some nice ideas. We're getting together again next Wednesday evening to discuss the directions for 2009 of our Rich Client group at InfoSupport.</p>
<p>Oh well... I still got a month. The call for papers is due februari 28th, send your proposals to <a href="mailto:papers@nljug.org">papers@nljug.org</a>. J-Spring 2009 will be at April 15th.</p>
