<p>6 months ago i started at Xebia. It's been a fun ride so far. Started working on a super cool mobile project with a user base soon to pass a million users.</p>
<p>Right now I'm enjoying a few weeks off. And I'm looking at where I'm at now and where I would like to go. Things have been very interesting the last 6 months.</p>
<p>And the most important news is, I'll working on my Open University education again. For my work I get to stay in hotels a lot and to keep my mind occupied on those evenings I think a few self study courses will do nicely.</p>
<p>Beware thoughâ€¦ This is the most important news for now...</p>
