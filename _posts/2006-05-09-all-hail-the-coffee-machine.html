<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/4753833.stm">Not walking to the coffee machine</a> can get you killed (almost in this instance). So please, fellow developers. Take that stroll to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee" rel="tag">coffee</a> machine for that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee" rel="tag">hot cup of brew</a>.</p>
<p>Not only serves the coffee machine a nice hot cup of coffee, <b>but</b> it can alse serve as a meeting hub for the occasional bit of chit chat. Hear the latest scoops on the project. Get to know your colleagues a little.</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Do visit the coffee machine...</p>
