<p>Reginald Hutchinson kicks off with an introduction of Sun's plans for the web2.0 and web 3.0 (cloud computing).</p>
<p>Smooth talker, says what have you a lot. As expected java fx is the next best thing. I'm curious when it will become final. Rich Internet applications are fun and easy to write with java fx. Riiiight....</p>
<p>Interesting note, December 2nd sun will  release java 6 update 10, an important update for swing based desktop java. Sun will rebebrand the javafx stack to platform specific brands (mobile, desktop, tv/topset box) some day next februari. </p>
<p>Chum-Munn Lee takes over with a demo of the latest Netbeans beta with a as of yet undisclosef java fx beta. Creates new fx project.</p>
<p>He creates a "under the sea" demo. Declarative display of an image. Next he makes the image dragable by implementing a few mouse listeners. Looks nice. Now he adds another picture. Adds a fade in/out with keyframes Looks simple enough, but it takes very little code. :) The end result is very rewarding considering the little time he used.</p>
<p>Next he deploys it on a browser. The end result is a java applet started from a jar through a standard javascript library.</p>
<p>Reginald takes over again and provides a few details about the upcomming java fx release. Something is up in 3 to 4 weeks.</p>
<p>Standard details about the java 6 update 10 release.</p>
<p>Simon Ritter takes over and kicks off another demo on an applied manner. He watched some guy (Johny Lee???) YouTube videos and wants to do the same with Java technology.</p>
<p>Wooden board with a Wii-mote and a projector??? Ah, he projects a playing card on the board. If he moves the wooden board, the image on the projector moves to stay on the board. The Wii-mote detects infrared signals sent by the board and based on the Wii-mote input the image is moved.     </p>
