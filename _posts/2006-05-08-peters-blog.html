<p>A colleague of mine blogs at our employers website. Now I chose against doing so, because of a reason I posted a bit earlier. Anyways, <a href="http://blogs.infosupport.com/peterhe/">Peter's blog</a> is not one that updates very regularly. But when he posts, he allways makes sure it's worth the read.</p>
<p>I know this will look like a huge plug. But Peter is hands down the best chap to work with. Peter and I worked together on our graduation assignment, so there's the reason for me shamelessly plugging a company blog of the company I'm working for.</p>
<p>Please be gentle with me... ;) But do take a peak at his blog.</p>
