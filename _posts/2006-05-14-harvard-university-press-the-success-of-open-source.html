<p>This was really a nice read. It provides a detailed account of open souce all the way from its roots to present day. The book is not technical, but for the interested developer it is a must read. First the author outlines his goals for the book, then the main course is served in the form of the historic account of open source. Then there is a chapter detailing research material based on existing and past open source projects, the motivations of the people behind the projects are disected. Also the driving forces behind open source communities are detailed in very interesting way.</p>
<p>And the book ends with the legal and social implications of open source. Which is not my cup of tea. :) But overall, a very interesting read about open-source. Overall a recommended read if you ask me.</p>
