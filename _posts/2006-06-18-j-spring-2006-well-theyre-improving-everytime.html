<p><a href="http://www.nljug.org"><img id="image74" src="/assets/nljug.gif" alt="Dutch Java User Group" style="float: left; margin: 5px" /></a>Last week I went to the J-Spring. I must say that the NL-JUG runs a tight ship when it comes o conferences. Which is a good thing. I've seen that girl with the 5 minute sign like a million times. Overall the entire conference was a solid excercize. Only complaint that I have is the length of the sessions. Most sessions lasted only 45 minutes. Now that's very little time for a technical presentation. One of the noticable effect was the feeling that a lot of speakers were rushing they're talk.</p>
<p>For an impression on the sessions themselves, check my colleague Peter's <a href="http://blogs.infosupport.com/peterhe/archive/2006/06/18/8057.aspx">blog entry</a>/<a href="http://blogs.infosupport.com/peterhe/articles/8056.aspx">article</a>.</p>
