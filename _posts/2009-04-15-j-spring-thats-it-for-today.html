<p>I've decided to skip the last round of sessions, it's sunny today and air in the session rooms is very warm and stale. Also the battery if my phone is almost dead. :)</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong><br />
I've updated all the posts of today, checked spelling, adjusted tags and uploaded photo's. Enjoy....</p>
