<p>One of the most visible effects of choosing either web or desktop technology is the way the resulting application will appear. Right now there are a couple of development frameworks to take into consideration. These are in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic web application</li>
<li>AJAX</li>
<li>Netbeans/Eclipse Rich Client</li>
<li>Swing/SWT application</li>
</ul>
<p><small>(This list is Java oriented.)</small></p>
<p>All of these have advantages and disadvantages. The list above can be divided into two main categories. To no surprise these are Web and Desktop. Anyway, right now I'm working for my employer on a document which ellaborates on these differences. Also I've submitted a proposal to the NL-JUG's upcomming J-Fall to do a talk about this subject for my employer. I hope they'll agree with me that it's an important subject to reflect on a bit.</p>
