<p><a href="http://blogs.infosupport.com/peterhe/archive/2006/05/30/7303.aspx">Peter mentioned</a> an <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/05/what_i_learned_.html">interesting link</a> on his blog.</p>
<p>It's about logging eye tracking on webpages. There's a movie you can click to. And first of all, it drives me crazy to see that blue ball ing around on the screen.</p>
<p>But it is interesting to see what a user actually looks at on a webpage/application/product/commercial/whatever.</p>
<p>Take a look at <a href="http://blog.eyetools.net/">this blog by Greg Edwards</a> for something called heatmaps. It kind of looks like a weather report, basicly you want the important stuff to show up red hot.</p>
