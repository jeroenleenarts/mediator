<p>Ever had the situation where you are unable to resolve a standoff. I certainly did.</p>
<p>Usually a little game of rock, paper scissors should resolve such issues.</p>
<p>Recently in the US a <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/06/07/magazines/fortune/rps_fortune/index.htm?cnn=yes">legal precedence</a> has been set.</p>
<p>Rock, paper, scissors is now a tool seen suitable for standoff resolution by the US's legal system.</p>

<p>Here's a copy of what seems like the <a href="http://www.worldrps.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=214&amp;Itemid=1">official court order</a>.</p>
