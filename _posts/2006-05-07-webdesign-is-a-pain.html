Sometimes it just plain hurts to see a user interface. :( Web desktop...</p>
<p>I won't go into details. But I've seen things, things you would very likely wish upon your worst enemy. (Since it isn't lethal or anything.)</p>
<p>Now to apply the things in this book. I've allways felt like I was a bit more design sensitive then most colleagues on a project. Guess I now have a book to slap them with.</p>
<p>The book isn't a reference, but it does give you a firm grasp of the mode of thinking you have to use when designing a UI. Most of all, there is no such thing as an average user. That was kind of an eye opener for me. Pick up this one, since it's a very short read, so it won't cost you that much effort. But it will make you better understand what users need/want.</p>
