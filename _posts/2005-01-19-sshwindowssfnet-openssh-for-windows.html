<p>Finally got around to setting up a SSH tunnel. I'm still running windows, but that'll change soon. Apple confirmed the shipment of my iMac.</p>
<p>Anyway, setting up SSH has been a real pain in the ass, or perhaps I'm just stupid...</p>
<p>Anyway, install the above on your windows box...<br />
Go to the install directory...</p>
<p>CD into the "bin" dir.<br />
enter: mkgroup -l &gt;&gt; ..\etc\group<br />
enter: mkpasswd -l -u "Your windows user name" &gt;&gt; ..\etc\passwd</p>
<p>Be a bit carefull with the user you are exporting remotely...</p>
<p>Now you can use any ssh client available with the mentioned user (PW same as in windows). Tunneling also works like a charm.<br />
With the standard ssh client of sshwindows: ssh -L 80:[networkPrivateMachine]:80 [yourIp]<br />
Now your can point a browser to your local machine (localhost). ssh tunnels it to the OpenSSH box at [yourIp] and forwards all request to [networkPrivateMachine] on your private network.</p>
<p>Check the docs on the mentioned site for details.</p>
