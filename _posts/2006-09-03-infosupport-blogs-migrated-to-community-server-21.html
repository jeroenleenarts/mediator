<p>I just got back from a little vacation in France and am working through the e-mail and RSS feeds that have pilled up only 8 days. And then I come across a nice surprise... (I won't mention the freakish time I'm typing this. ;)</p>
<p>My employer finally decided to migrate to a decent blog platform. Until recently they've been running an ancient .Text install. And let me tell you, it was not so pretty and lacked lots of handy blogging features like a decent comment spam filter, auto ping-back, track-back and tagging support.</p>

<p>Make sure to <a href="http://blogs.infosupport.com/">take a peak</a>. Right now I'm proud of the InfoSupport blogs. For those unfamiliar with the old look and feel, let's just say I just tried not to mention our blogs, since they just that ugly to look at. The layout didn't do justice to the actual content.</p>
<p>Also a few weeks back I gave a presentation to my co-workers about blogging in general. I also mentioned some handy features and things missing from the then current implementation. Although I'd like to think I caused this migration I just didn't. But I do think that because of my presentation some people thought: "Well, to hell with .Text. Let's do this migration from .Text to Community Server and be done with it." From what I heard it was migration fraught with pitfalls and possible data-loss when done incorrectly. I'd say, well done and enjoy the new blogging environment.</p>

It's <a href="http://communityserver.org/">Community Server</a>. A Microsoft .Net based blogging solution. It's one of the few serious blogging servers available. Unlike Wordpress it supports multiple blogs straight out of the box. It's comparable with <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/">SixApart's Movable Type</a></p>
