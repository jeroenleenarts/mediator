<p>Last night my employer threw a christmas party. The invitation said "Tenue de ville". So almost everybody was dressed classy. Anyway, I almost got blasted ;) Usually I never drink any alchohol, but sometimes... (like once a year or so) Anyway, I only had 5 or six "Hertog Jan". It's a beer, but not just beer like buds or heineken. Noooo.... This is a bit stronger. It's a dark beer.</p>
<p>Anyway... Had lots of fun, but this morning my head was a bit painfull, couldn't eat breakfast. So I just skipped all that and checked out and went home.</p>
<p>Good to see my colleagues in a different setting. One thing though... Yesterday evening I had a minute to myself and was looking over the dance floor and I thought... "My my, gorgeous women... Wow!! Wait... Party.. Work... Colleagues... Tech company... Women = Colleagues partners. Shit!! I think I'll get another beer."</p>
<p>As I said, lots of fun.</p>
