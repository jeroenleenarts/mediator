<p>There is a lot of stuff going on here in the second half of this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's probably a guest lecture coming up for a shark pool of students. :p</li>
<li>I'm going to be supervising a graduate student for my employer.</li>
<li>From what I understand there will be counseling a group of second and third year student in customer role for nine weeks as well.</li>
<li>There's something interesting about Eclipse Europa around the corner to in a few months.</li>
<li>Still working on my own education, I really need to give that a bit of a kicker.</li>
<li>Not to mention the fact that there is also my latest contract which is lots of fun, but also very intense right now. Since I have to get a grasp at the problem domain and the existing implementation at the same time. But we're getting there.</li>
<li>I've heard something about a code review coming up for another customer which will require some effort on my part.</li>
<li>Let's not forget the request my employer has made about certification. They really would like me to get started on a java business components certification followed by a java architect certification.</li>
<li>Not to mention the things I do besides work. There are lots of things happening there as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>When to plan my vacation... Oh man... I better get started...</p>
