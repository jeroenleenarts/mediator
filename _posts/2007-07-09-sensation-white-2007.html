<p>A post a bit out of character for me. But what the heck, it's my blog right?</p>
<p>Last weekend I went to Sensation White with a few friends. Actually, 2 of I kinda knew beforehand. The rest I met once or twice.</p>
<p>Anyway, it was mind blowing. Too bad a certain person couldn't be there. But then again I don't <strong><em>think</em></strong> it would have been her thing anyway. But perhaps it would, because we would be there together. I dunno... :P</p>
<p>Here are some shots, thanks to Joyce who actually thought about bringing a camera.</p>

<p>Oh, and uhm Erick E. sucked!! I know there are people who will disagree. Post that or other comments if you feel like doing so.</p>
