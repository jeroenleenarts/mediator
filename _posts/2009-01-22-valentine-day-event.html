<p>Maybe you already knew, there is something special 00:31:30 Saturday February 14, 2009 in Europe/Amsterdam?</p>
<p>It's 23:31:30 Friday February 13, 2009 in UTC. Now that's an interesting moment.</p>
<p>At that time, how many seconds since 00:00:00 Januari 1, 1970 is it again? Well, not exactly 1234567890 seconds ago anyway.</p>
<p>But it so happens to be that unix systems keep time by counting the seconds from 00:00:00 Januari 1, 1970. And <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">unix time does not count the leap seconds</a>, so guess what... When it is 23:31:30 Friday February 13, 2009 in UTC or 00:31:30 Saturday February 14, 2009 in Europe/Amsterdam on your system's clock, the internal unix time counter will indeed contain the value 1234567890.</p>
