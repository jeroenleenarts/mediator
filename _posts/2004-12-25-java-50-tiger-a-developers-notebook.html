<p>Recently I bought this book. It's an excellent read. Do note that you have have some experience writing software in Java releases prior to Java 5.0.</p>
<p>The book introduces the new language features in a code oriented approach. This results in a very quick and solid introduction into the new language features of Java 5.0. Don't forget about the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/relnotes/features.html">other new features of Java 5.0</a> though.</p>
