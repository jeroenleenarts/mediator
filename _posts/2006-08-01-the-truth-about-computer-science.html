<p>Normally I just don't do it. I don't like link blogs at all. But today Joel Spolsky posted something that is so true, it just plain hurts when you realise it. I just have to make an exception, because it aligns with my personal view perfectly.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/01.html">Can Your Programming Language Do This?</a></p>
<p>This is true in the Netherlands too. All they teach/learn at comp-sci these days is <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java</a> or <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/">.NET</a>. Such a waste, because these guys & girls get a degree without even having tasted or seen functional programming. There are exceptions. But most of the time, too bad.</p>
<p>Rest assured, I won't go link whoring on this blog.</p>
