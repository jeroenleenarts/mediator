<p>Just cruising the internet a bit while watching some soccer (TOG vs FRA). Not much up here. Busy setting up a brand new truly awesome blog somewhere else. ;)</p>
<p><a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/top/free-copy-of-55-ways-to-have-fun-with-google-182783.php">I came accross this little piece of work.</a> I have lifehacker in my news reader, because every so often something funny/sweet/really handy comes along.</p>
<p>Lifehacker informs us of a book available for free. Free as in free beer. Take a peek at http://www.55fun.com/ for the PDF version. You can just download it. And it's not truly amazing, but it's very welcome as a substitute to a very dull soccer match.</p>
<p>I know this is not my regular kind of blog entry, but hey. It's weekend. :P</p>
<p><small>Updated 29-June: You are looking at my new blog hosted at http://blog.leenarts.net</small></p>
