<p>In my opinion a lot of companies are going to make decisions in the near future about using Web 2.0 or Rich Client for their next end-user applications. Both have their respective strong and weak points.</p>
<p>Over the next couple of weeks I intend to put up some postings about my opinion on various aspects of Web 2.0 compared to Rich Client development. Since I myself am mostly involved with Java software development I will focus on the aspects of frameworks and platforms based on the Java language.</p>
<p>For this intro, let's lay down some basics by defining what Web 2.0 and Rich Client is.</p>
<p>I've found a nice definition of Web 2.0 at  <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/10/web_20_compact_definition.html">O'Reilly Radar</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Web 2.0 is the network as platform, spanning all connected devices; Web 2.0 applications are those that make the most of the intrinsic advantages of that platform: delivering software as a continually-updated service that gets better the more people use it, consuming and remixing data from multiple sources, including individual users, while providing their own data and services in a form that allows remixing by others, creating network effects through an "architecture of participation," and going beyond the page metaphor of Web 1.0 to deliver rich user experiences.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Now on to Rich Client. There is a very good definition available at <a href="http://searchsmb.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,290660,sid44_gci1155694,00.html">TechTarget.com</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
A rich client is a networked computer that has some resources installed locally but also depends on other resources distributed over the network. The rich client's configuration is somewhere between that of a thin client, which relies largely upon network-distributed resources, and a fat client which has most resources installed locally.
