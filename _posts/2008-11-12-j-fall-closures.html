<p>Huub van Thienen has a session about closures. Closures is a new upcomming expension scheduled for inclusion in Java 7. Three proposals are currently in development.</p>
<p>Closures are from functional languages. I'll add some more links on this subject later.</p>
<p>Interesting subject, nice technical depth.  </p>
