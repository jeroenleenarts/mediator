<p><a href="http://blog.leenarts.net/2006/05/10/magic-keywords-give-a-blog-a-free-sexy-swing-in-the-visitor-count/">Seems like cheesy pick-up lines don't work here either.</a></p>
<p>Well experiment is over. I did pick up a few extra visitors because of my target rich blog entry. You know, targets like "free", "sex" and "mp3" in them. ;)  But not as much as I'd expected, must have been my obvious blog entry header. Probably had the same effect as a bad pick-up line or something.</p>
<p>When I can, I'll swing a hot word or two right in. But I promise I won't use those keywords anymore when they are out of context for the post. That's just not my cup of java. Like: "I don't swing that way." Getting free visitors looking for porn shouldn't even be here. Since this blog isn't about porn or free MP3's.</p>
<p>LOL, Ok enough fun and tacky attempts to integrate cheesy keywords.</p>
<p>Oh, one more thing: Best wishes to my friends at the JavaOne, wish I could have been there too. ;)</p>
