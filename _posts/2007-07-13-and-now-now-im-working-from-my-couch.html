<p>While I'm at it. I'm working from my couch right now. So far it's great. No distractions at all. I can play the music I like all day.</p>
<p>One disadvantage... Nobody interupts me, so I must be carefull to take my breaks every now and then. (Writing this post is one of them.)</p>
<p>So thumbs up over here... (While scratching my head.)</p>

I just noticed, I am wearing the same t-shirt for three days. Now THAT... is bad.</p>
