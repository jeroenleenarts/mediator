<p><a href="http://www.python.org"><img id="image101" src="/assets/python-logo.gif" alt="Python logo" style="float: left" /></a> I'll be taking over a few tasks while a colleague of mine is taking some well deserved R&R. The thing is, I've heard it involves Python. *sweet* ;)</p>
<p>That does mean I'll be scrapping my Ruby experimentation, because I have to brush up my Python skills a bit. It's been a while since I've done any serious Python coding.</p>
<p>If you're looking into Python too, <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/tut/">start here</a>. Oh and, MacOSX 10.4 comes with Python 2.3.5 pre-installed.</p>
