<p>Just a note for anyone subscribed to the feed of this blog. I've updated to feedburner. So please update your feed URL to <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/SomethingAwfull">Feedburner: Something awfull...</a>. By switching to feedburner I get an insight into how many people are subscribed.</p>
<p>And you as a subscriber will be able to happily travel with me if I ever switch the location of my blog. So the benifit is twofold.</p>
<p>I've tweaked the Blogger template as to help ppl use the correct feed in the future.</p>
