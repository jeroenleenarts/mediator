<p>After a couple of months working on a project going from bad to worst it's a relieve to finally be on a new assigment. The project I'm in is about building a logistic planning application. It involves planning manpower, material and tracks. Oh did I mention that making the plan for one year takes 200 people nine (!!) months to complete. Talk about a complex process. :)</p>
<p>Anyway, I'll be doing all kinds og GUI related work based on Eclipse 3.0.1 RCP (Rich Client Platform). Never done that before... :P This will look good on my resume.</p>
