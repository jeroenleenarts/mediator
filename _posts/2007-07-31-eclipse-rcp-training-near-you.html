<p>Eclipse.org published an <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/org/press-release/20070731_RCPtraining.php" title="Eclipse news: Eclipse RCP Training" target="_blank">interesting news bulletin</a> today. It appears Eclipse RCP classes are comming to a city near you. Have a <a href="http://www.regonline.com/CalendarNET/EventCalendar.aspx?CustomerId=240004&amp;EventId=143622&amp;view=Month" title="Dates Eclipse classes" target="_blank">look over here for the current time-table</a>. I did not do a background check of the people giving the course, but hey, it only costs 1100 euros. A ridiculous low price if you ask me. What is the catch? Or is it heavily sponsored by Eclipse.org? My employer has a <a href="http://www.infosupport.nl/Training/CursusInfo?CourseCode=JASWI" title="InfoSupport Swing Training" target="_blank">three day java Swing course</a> available for 1350 euros. That's one day less AND it costs more.</p>
<p>I am very curious about this. If the quality is good (how can it be for so little money) it is a bargain! Any thoughts on this will be much appreciated. Especially on how they can do this for such a small fee.</p>
