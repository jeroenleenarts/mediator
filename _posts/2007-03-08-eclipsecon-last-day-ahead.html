<p>Well, it's the last day already at EclipseCon 2007. But today is promising<br />
to be the most exciting day of them all. When EclipseCon is over Stefan<br />
and I have planned to drive up to San Francisco for a meal and some<br />
sightseeing. I've heard there is supposed to be some cool bridge there. ;)</p>
<p>The program for today is typical for any last conference's day. While<br />
still very technical and interesting there are a few more reflecting and<br />
contemplating sessions. Good stuff indeed.</p>
<p>The only problem right now is breakfast. Stefan and I forgot to discuss<br />
what to do with breakfast. Will it be the conference sweetrolled sugar<br />
rush inducing snack at the conference floor or the huge fat saturated<br />
hotel hot meal. Kind of a hard choice, because I just want my bowl of<br />
vanilla yoghurt with breakfast cereal. *sob*</p>
<p>But as to be expected I will endure these challenges and come through with<br />
flying colors.</p>
<p>Only problem left is to decide if I should start banging on Stefan's door<br />
to wake him up or not...</p>
