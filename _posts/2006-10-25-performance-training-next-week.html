<p>Next week I am attending a course offered by Xebia <a href="http://www.nljug.org/pages/events/partnercalendar/00026/">through the NL-JUG</a>. It&#8217;s about <a href="http://www.javaperformancetuning.com/">Java Performance tuning</a>.</p>
<p>They are claiming Kirk Pepperdine from <a href="http://www.javaperformancetuning.com/">Java Performance tuning</a> will be there as well. I am curious how much face time we will actually have with Kirk. I won&#8217;t be surprised if he pops his nose through the door for a bit and is off again. But on the other hand, he could be doing the whole course just as well. But my guess is he&#8217;ll be there for the full four days. <a href="http://www.xebia.com/item.php?ID=98&amp;C=2">Here&#8217;s the course description.</a></p>
<p>An interesting observation I&#8217;ve done is that the <a href="http://www.xebia.com/file_db/File/SpeedupCourse8.pdf">Xebia course description</a> seems to match up perfectly with this page on the <a href="http://www.javaperformancetuning.com/training.shtml">Java Performance tuning site</a>. That would seem to suggest that someone from Java Performance tuning is attending and he&#8217;s bringing along all the instruction material as well.</p>
<p>I guess that&#8217;s one way to offer a course. A simple matter of reselling.</p>
<p>One last point. The confirmation said that the attendee should bring their own laptop with Java 5.0 SDK installed and wireless network support. That includes my Apple PB too I guess.</p>
