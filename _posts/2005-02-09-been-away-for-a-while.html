<p>Last week I've been away on a snowboarding vacation.</p>
<p>It was very relaxing, and now I find myself struggling to pick up the pace of everyday life. I guess worst things could happen, but still it's a pain. :)</p>
<p>I also finally had some time to play around with my new iMac 20'' G5. This machine is very cool. Now all I have to do is get some more software for it. But I'm woring on that... I'm able to get some things through my employer. I like to stay on the legal side of the law if I can. :)</p>
