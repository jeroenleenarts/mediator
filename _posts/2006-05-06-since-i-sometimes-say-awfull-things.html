<p>As you can see in my blogging history I've been away for a while. Bad isn't it?</p>
<p>My company starting a blogging portal on their internet site. But because I would like a little bit more breathing room about what I can and can not tell you ppl. I decided to revive this old blog.</p>
<p>Hope I can keep it going a bit more now. Whish me luck.</p>
<p>(I will keep any non-disclosable's to myself and respect any disclosure timings requested both explicitly and implicitly by my employer.)</p>
