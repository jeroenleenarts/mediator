<p>I'm still looking for a nice AJAX screen-shot for my presentation at J-FALL next Wednesday. I do have some candidates, but none are that impressive yet. AJAX is one of those technologies that you really have to see in action to appreciate. Anyway, if you know or have an impressive AJAX example and can provide me with a nice screen-shot, drop me a comment. I'll be sure to insert proper credit.</p>
