<p>Phew, back from the JavaOne 2009 again.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/dscf0130.jpg" alt="Too bad Jonathan's assistent didn't allow my camera to focus." border="0" width="333" height="250" style="float: right; margin: 5px" /> First time I've been there. And boy could you feel the recession at the JavaOne... I think the number of visitors was at an all time low. Also in San Francisco itself recession was around you. Loads and loads of properties available for lease or sale.</p>
<p>But me and my colleagues did our best to support the global and local economy by living large. :) Besides the conference we did all sorts of fun activities. I even biked the Golden Gate the last Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>I also learned a valuable lesson when returning from another time-zone. When I got home I did some things and then went to my girl's place. I should've asked her to keep me awake at all costs. Sunday I sat down on her couch and I kind of instantly fell asleep. I paid the price on Monday and Tuesday. Fortunately my employer was very understanding about Monday and Tuesday I'll recover by working a few extra hours this week or next week. :)</p>
<p>More to come later. Suffice to say that on record nobody from Sun was allowed to spill any details on the Oracle/Sun merger. I understood of the record that there will be another JavaOne next year. Let's hope that by then it is clear what will happen with Java, cause right now it's anybodies guess what Oracle has in store for us. I'm expecting a whole lot, but it is still a bit early to say what exactly Oracle will keep and what Oracle will throw away. I do think JavaFX is here to stay though, the new JavaFX 1.2 is a major improvement compared to the 1.1 release. Check <a href="http://blogs.infosupport.com/blogs/paul_bakker/archive/2009/06/04/javaone-javafx-1-2-released.aspx">Paul Bakker's entry on JavaFX</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Too bad the assistant of Jonathan Swartz didn't allow my camera to focus properly.</p>
<p>Also many thanks to Bert, Paul, Marcel and Hans for being such great travel companions throughout the week.</p>
