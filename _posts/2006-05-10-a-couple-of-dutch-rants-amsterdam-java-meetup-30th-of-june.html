<p><a href="http://blogs.infosupport.com/peterhe/archive/2006/02/15/3812.aspx">A colleague of mine went to the previous meet-up.</a> And he said it was worth it.</p>
<p>So I'll guess I'll have to look into this now. From what I've read the early birds get free beer. (Not like in "free speech".) Esspecially since <a href="http://gathering.tweakers.net/forum/user_profile/27717">Alarmnummer</a> is convinced we've never spoken IRL. Guess I'll have to prove him wrong then. :D</p>
<p>Anyways, what's this meet-up about? It's sort of a flash mob idea. Set a time, set a place and then just show up and make the bartender happy. It's a social event and with Java as a shared interest. Should be interresting.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on <a href="http://blog.arendsen.net/">Olaf Arendsen's A Couple of Dutch Rants weblog</a> for more info. He has planned the meet-up on june 30th at 6pm, only the location is not yet set.</p>
