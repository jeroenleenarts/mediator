<p>Just applied for Google AdSense. Which I think is great. When you google, do you notice the tiny adds on the right side of the search page? I do and their great. With Google AdSense you can do the same for your site. Google indexes your site and makes targeted adds available. You can then display these in a non intrusive way with a small javascript. (Do check their policy!)</p>
