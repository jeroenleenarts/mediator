<p><a href="http://www.nljug.org"><img id="image74" src="/assets/nljug.gif" alt="Dutch Java User Group" style="float: left; margin: 5px" /></a> A few days back I posted about my session proposal to the <a href="http://www.nl-jug.org">NL-JUG</a>'s J-Spring. Three proposols came in for a <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven 2</a> session. And it seems I failed the cut. Too bad for me. </p>
<p>I will definatly attend the J-Spring though. It's an excellent place to see some old friends again and catch a few presenations. There will probably be a Maven 2 session, since it matches very nicely with the overall theme of this J-Spring. So I will probably sit in on that one to see if I missed any details on the subject. And I'll have a few unanswered questions handy as well if I'm in the mood.</p>
<p>Also I'd recommend every dutch Java developer to <b>join the NL-JUG</b>. Great way to meet and greet, make new contacts, learn stuff and if you're on a job hunt, get a few job offerings.</p>
