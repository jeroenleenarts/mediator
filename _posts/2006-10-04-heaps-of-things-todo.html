<p>Yeah, I know I&#8217;m not the only one with things to do. But man is this week packed or what?</p>
<ul>
<li>Monday night a friend stopped by who I am helping out with keeping a (sweet) secret</li>
<li>Do some Salsa dancing on tuesday night (ok this is sort of relaxing)</li>
<li>Busy preparing a conference presentation which is next week, about Java user interfaces</li>
<li>Preparing a meet-up for my Master of Science, something with business rules and formal markdown</li>
<li>Not to mention the dentist, I hate that guy</li>
<li>Running two contracts simultaneously
<ul>
<li>Also this week marks the last week in the shorter one of the two. So deliveries to deliver</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And I get the feeling I am forgetting something. :( My schedule doesn&#8217;t mention anything&#8230; oh dear&#8230; what is it.</li>
</ul>
<p>What it comes down to is this&#8230; I barely have time to sleep and today I already am having a hard time not taking an aspirin. So today I made it, I&#8217;ll go crash early tonight. A simple situation, I could keep on working or I can max out my time in bed tonight. Knowing myself I&#8217;d better get to sleep soon, else I&#8217;ll regret it tomorrow. :)</p>
<p>Fortunately next week I&#8217;m back on one contract again, the presentation has been given, no dentist and by then I&#8217;ll have remembered what I am forgetting right now. Anyway, for those of you who haven&#8217;t heard from me in a while&#8230; Now you know why.</p>
<p><b>Edit (5th october, 9:16 in the morning):</b> I remember now. I promised a week ago I would have a review done last monday. Oops... next time I'll mark it down in my calendar.</p>
