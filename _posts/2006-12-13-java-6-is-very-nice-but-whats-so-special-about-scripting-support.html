<p><img src="/assets/openjdklogo.png" alt="OpenjdkLogo" title="" style="float: left; margin: 5px;" /> As any Java minded developer I also heard about the release of Java 6. While I could whine on about the fact that it is released and that it's great, I don't think that would add anything to the current buzz on the internet. I'd say read the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/webnotes/">release notes</a> and your done with that. Don't forget to click to the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/webnotes/features.html">new features and enhancements page</a>.</p>
<p>But I do want to share a little email discussion I had with a collegue. Java 6 has scripting support built in. Now scripting in a Java VM is nothing new. Then why the hell is everybody drooling over this scripting support in Java 6? The only real change is that it's now possible to work through a standardized API. Before Java 6 it was already possible to do scripting in Java. My guess would be that most of the engines mentioned <a href="https://scripting.dev.java.net/#engines">on this page</a> could be used with earlier Java VM versions.</p>
<p>Oh and let me make a prediction. I am guessing that there is going to be a lot of talk about domain specific languages in Java, which will most likely be called DSL in a matter of weeks. :)</p>
<p>One cool thing I did find out about when plucking through the new features of Java 6: <a href="http://sisc.sourceforge.net/sisc-online.php">An Applet demonstrating a fully Scheme R5RS compliant Scheme implementation called SICS</a><br />
Don't know why but it made me smile. :P</p>
