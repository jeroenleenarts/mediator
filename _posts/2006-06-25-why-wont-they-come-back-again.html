<p>I just checked my visitor logs today. And there's this handy little graph showing the visitors a day, in a month. Here's the latest monthly graph:<br />

<p>You can imagine that I thought: "What the heck is up with that?" After checking my referrals logs it was obvious. Something I put on Joel Spolsky's discussion forum. Readers of my blog now what I mean.</p>
<p>Now, as you can see, that's a freaking weird graph. It was caused by a certain event. The thing that bugs me the most is the actual subject for this spike. I'd rather had it because of another blog posting. Because the visitors in this spike just won't stick I'm affraid. Simply because it was not a regular kind of entry for this blog.</p>
<p>I'm of sulking now, trying to think up ways to get people to "stick".</p>
