<p>For some reason installing Office for Mac 2008 all in one go (installation, SP1 update and updates) led to a severely broken installation.</p>
<p>Read somewhere on the internet that I should've rebooted my system after every installation. That's 5 reboots for you, once after initial install, once after SP1 update, once after a point release, once after a second point release and once for an auto updater update. Jikes!</p>
<p>Rebooting like a mad mad did result in a working system though. Don't know why. Tried it n two separate clean OSX installs and it went off without a glitch. Except for the insane amount of rebooting that is.</p>
