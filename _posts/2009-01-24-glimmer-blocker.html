<p>I usually don't plug software I use.</p>
<p>But this one is just too good not to tell. About a month ago I installed a new new preference pane on my Mac OSX install called <a href="http://glimmerblocker.org/">Glimmer Blocker</a>. It's a great add blocker. Most people know something like <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/addon/1865">Adblock Plus</a> for <a href="http://getfirefox.com">FireFox</a>.</p>
<p>On Mac OSX there haven't been to many good add block solutions. There are the brwoser specific blockers here an there. And especially the ones for Safari are nasty ones, input manager hacked ugliness.</p>
<p>With Glimmer Blocker, no more! It's a system wide http proxy with no detectable latency overhead. It work for all your systems browsers. And you can subscribe to a blocker definition feed. It has more nice features too.</p>
<p>Only downside, you need to run Mac OSX 10.5.</p>
