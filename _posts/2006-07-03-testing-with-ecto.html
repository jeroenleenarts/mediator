<p><a href="http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/" title="Ecto"><img src="/assets/ecto_1281.jpg" height="127" width="123" alt="Ecto" title="Ecto" style="margin: 5px; float: left" /></a> Testing with Ecto... Besides MarsEdit I am also trying Ecto. Ecto does have Amazon posting. But image editing is way to complex for my taste.</p>
<p>I'll give both tools a good spin, but I expect that I will actually like the Wordpress web interface best. :D Both tools seem to have their own strengths and weaknesses. I wonder if there might be any other contenders.</p>
<p>Also Ecto has <a href="http://growl.info" alt="Link to Growl website">Growl</a> support. I like Growl support.</p>
