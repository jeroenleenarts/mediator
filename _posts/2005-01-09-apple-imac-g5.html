<p>Call me crazy, but I'm getting one of these. I'm just waiting for the keynote of Apple's CEO on 11 januari, maybe they'll have some new stuff for their product line. Would be a shame to buy something and two weeks later hear that something better is coming out real soon.</p>
<p>Yes. it's an Apple. But did you know <a href="http://www.apple.com/pro/science/gosling/">James Gosling works on Apple</a> too? So it should be a reasonable alternative for me as a Java Developer.</p>
