<p>My kickoff of the week was a session hosted by Boris Bokowski, Jim des<br />
Rivieres and John Arthorne.</p>
<p>They started a session which was a bit different from what I expected. But<br />
in the end it was a very interesting session about the aspects of proper<br />
API design. The whole session revolved around the effects of introducing<br />
Java 5 features into an API.</p>
<p>After a general introduction on API design with key statements like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Language used in API is important. (API means public interfaces along<br />
with it's documentation and specification)</li>
<li>Start with a minimal API, opening up "doors" is easy. Closing them is<br />
a royal pain.</li>
<li>Watch out for binary compatibility between releases built with<br />
different compilers.</li>
</ul>
<p>After this general intro it started of with some Java 5 bashing. :)</p>
<ul>
<li>Auto boxing is bad, lots of temporary objects.</li>
<li>Variable arity methods are bad. They obscure the method call signs<br />
actually being called. Especially when combined with overloading.</li>
<li>Binary compatibility breakage is the bane of your API life.</li>
</ul>
<p>The thing is, Java 5 contains loads of cool features, but usage of these<br />
features can cause binary incompatibility. Which requires your API users<br />
to do full rebuilds. Something which you want to avoid when bringing a<br />
version update to your users. Some things ca be done without causing<br />
binary incompatibility.</p>
<p>While I didn't expect the content provided, it was a very interesting<br />
subject. Personally I've never been in a situation where a full rebuild<br />
was a problem. But then again all I know is enterprise development. Alle<br />
major new language features of Java 5 were discussed. I've learned a lot<br />
in this session, I wonder when and if I will ever need this knowledge. But<br />
I had provided me with insights into the problems API providers face.</p>
