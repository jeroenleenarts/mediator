<p>Last night I installed the final release of Callisto with Eclipse 3.2 on my mac. And it works like a charm so far. Earlier release candidates were often broken on OSX. But this seems solid. Also the sheer amount of functionality is just overwhelming, where do I start with exploring all the goodies provided by the Callisto release plug-ins?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/callisto/" style="float: right; margin: 5px"><img id="image84" src="/assets/largeCallistoHere.gif" alt="Callisto is here..." /></a>Compared to previous Eclipse OSX releases Eclipse seems a lot more polished now. Sure there are some gripes, like scroll-bars appearing in the description field of the new project wizard. But it is getting better and better. Guess I will be doing some <a href="http://wbeaton.blogspot.com/">Wayne Beaton</a> inspired evangelising on my current project next week. (Basically this would mean raising my hands into the air, exclaim why I think Eclipse is best, then kindly respond to all questions being asked. I won't go swimming in a frozen lake though.)</p>
<p>I have been goofing around a bit last night, I smacked together some user interfaces with <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/vep/">VE</a>. Which is also part of the Callisto release. It seems to work ok, but still it doesn't have the flexibility of rolling the views yourself. I'm not sure yet if I really like Visual Editor, but the rest of Callisto: Awesome! :P</p>
