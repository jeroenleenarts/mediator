<p>Today I've helped a co-worker a bit with centering something on an Eclipse view. Some nasty stuff with padding Composites and such.</p>
<p>To center one control on a view we actually added 3 extra empty composites to push things to the right spot. This got to be easier to do.</p>
<p>Suggestions are very welcome.</p>
