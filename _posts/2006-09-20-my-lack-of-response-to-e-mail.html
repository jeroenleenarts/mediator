<p>My webhosting provider has had a critical failure in their mail service. They assured me that no message will be lost. Somewhere about 30 hours ago the ReiserFS file system of the mail server went corrupt. They have repaired the file system, and are in the process of working through the backlogged e-mail. In total they have to munch on 260 gigabytes(!!) of data. Wow...</p>
<p>The have speeded up the delivery of a new mail cluster system. It should provide a more robust system. While the current system was rock solid already, it has the vulnerability of being a single system (with proper disk clustering).</p>
<p>So if you mailed me about something, hang on I will reply when needed.</p>
