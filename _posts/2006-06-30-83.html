<p>The whole opensource java thing keeps on going and going. At the Javaone they anounced it. Now some Sun Microsystems suit said it is possible within months. The keyword in this statement is <em>possible</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Great</em></strong> that it's possible, but will it actually happen within a few months?</p>
