<p>While posting from the J-Spring conference with my iPhone I noticed the Wordpress App (v.1.21) crashed a lot when trying to upload pictures. It worked wonderful at the last J-Fall. I sure hope they'll fix this, cause I can not find a solution or workaround on the web at the moment. Perhaps re-installing the Wordpress App might work?</p>
