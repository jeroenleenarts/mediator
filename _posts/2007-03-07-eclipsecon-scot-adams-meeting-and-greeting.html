<p>Tuesday turned out to be a day with lots of chatting and hand-shaking. It<br />
was a very engaging day and I talked to lots of people and heard lots of<br />
interesting stuff. It also was very nice to see that people are very<br />
interested in the <a href="http://blog.leenarts.net/2006/09/28/train-spotting-sort-of/">project<br />
I participated in at the Dutch railways</a>. I got a lot of questions<br />
about the involved parties and the technologies used within the project.</p>
<p>I knew the work at the Dutch Railways was very cool, but now I am totally<br />
convinced. It is a project which will actually have an impact on the<br />
person traveling by train. Now that is something cool to realize.</p>
<p>Anyways, I had a nice chat with <a href="http://wbeaton.blogspot.com/">Wayne Beaton</a> about Eclipse and<br />
opportunities it might provide. Wayne also was very helpful in suggesting<br />
ways to step up Eclipse for my employer. Wayne, thanks a million, you can<br />
be sure I'll get back to you in the near future.</p>
<p>Also I was at the Ingress boot and I forgot the name of the person I was<br />
talking to. It was a british guy with a cool british accent currently<br />
living in Germany. You could feel he was convinced of the quality of his<br />
companies product. Very cool to see, and very engaging. I'll be sure to<br />
try out Ingress myself. (It's an open-source database, with all the<br />
enterprise features MySQL doesn't have.) Ingress has an interesting<br />
history dating back something like 30 years.</p>
<p>I also got involved in an IBM sumo wrestling match. It never got throw to<br />
the floor, but couldn't keep myself inside the ring. Stefan just told me<br />
he got a nasty picture of me as a sumo guy. Be sure to get back here,<br />
because I am going to post pictures.</p>
<p>Now I am sitting in a TPTP session on thursday already. Still recovering<br />
from the bar meeting Stefan (A coworker who is also here.) and I had. That<br />
bit of scotch turned out to be too much already. Not a headache, but still<br />
I can feel I could have slept a bit better.</p>
<p>Scot Adams had the keynote on tuesday. While it was a very funny talk it<br />
was a bit hard to find how Scot Adams relates to the EclipseCon. He also<br />
had some message on the fact that he believes that luck is something<br />
people are more likely to find I they have a more open mind an broad<br />
vision. The anecdotes he had to tell were very funny, especially how<br />
certain comics are based on real life events in his own personal live. But<br />
in the ned I could feel it was a chat he'd done a million times. But a<br />
good and funny talk it most certainly was.</p>
