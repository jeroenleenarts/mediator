<p>Now I must admit I have not ran the second beta myself. I hate beta OS-es. They're always a big pain in the hiny.</p>
<p>But today I came accross this <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/windows-vista-beta/windows-vista-beta-a-lot-like-mac-os-x-179909.php">blog entry</a>. I mean, just look at it. To me this is proof that OSX is infact better then Vista. Haha! Not to mention that eventhough Vista is a visual improvement, it's still ugly.</p>
<p>Funny to see that first a lot of people were saying: "Ohw, all that visual stuff on a mac, who needs it. It only slows us down."<br />
And now it's all: "Oooh, aaaah, looky here how nice Vista is going to look."</p>
<p>Come on ppl, get a life. Not to mention that it will take about half a decade before Vista is in common use.</p>
<p>Call me a Mac fanboy if you want. But just look at <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/windows-vista-beta/windows-vista-beta-a-lot-like-mac-os-x-179909.php">these comparisons</a>. Are you still able to say that Vista is the next big step in OS design...</p>
