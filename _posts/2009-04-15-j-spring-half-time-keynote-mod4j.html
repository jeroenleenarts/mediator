<p>Jos Warmer has the midday keynote. He has an introductory talk on the <a href="http://www.mod4j.org/">Mod4J</a> project.</p>
<p>Jos is an MDA enthusiast and as always makes a case for the model driven approach. Check the Internet for more details. I'll post some links and info later, now I'll just sit back a bit and relax a bit before jumping into the remaining sessions.<br />
