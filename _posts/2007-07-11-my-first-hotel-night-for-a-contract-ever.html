<p>For a new contract I am going to stay the night in a hotel every now and then. The job is kinda far from home for me. So the client and my employer agreed to let me stay in a hotel and let me work from home. Seems reasonable to me. (Don't worry my employer discussed this with me properly.) Also there is a matter of Java Swing technology and oh something with the latest and greatest Java version 6 (update 2 already?).</p>
<p>Now why on earth would I stay in a hotel for work? Well there are a number of advantages. First: You work crazy hours a few days because there is nothing better to do. Second: You can take this time back at the end of the week where it's more precious to me to actually have those hours for myself. Especially next week, I hope.</p>
<p>The room is rather small. Doesn't have a bath tub, only a shower and a toilet. But!! There is free wireless... Fast free wireless. So I am not complaining at all. I brought enough stuff to do... Work and university related. The important thing is to keep myself busy enough so I don't start feeling lonely or cramped up in here.</p>
<p>To give you a sense of the size where I am sitting now:</p>
