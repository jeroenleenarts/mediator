It probably already was available, I just didn't know it was. The Sudoku game Wayne has been working on is available for download.</p>
<p>Just import <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/evangelism/samples/sudoku/sudoku.psf" title="Eclipse Sudoku Project Set">this project set</a> into your Eclipse install and you are ready to go. You will be asked for CVS credentials. Just enter <em>anonymous</em> as a user-name and leave the password field blank or enter your email address. </p>
<p>Now you've got a sweet little application to molest to your hearth's content. Complex enough to feel real, but small enough to get into in a short time-span.</p>
