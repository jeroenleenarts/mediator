<p><a href="http://blogs.infosupport.com/peterhe/archive/2006/06/26/8461.aspx">Peter's blog</a> pointed me to a <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/06/then_things_pro.html">entry by Seth Godin</a> about how marketing and programmers usually bite eachother and why it is important to guard against certain default behaviours.</p>
<p>To support the point made by Peter I'd like to suggest a book I've read: <a href="http://blog.leenarts.net/2006/05/07/webdesign-is-a-pain/">Don't make me think</a>. This book is a good illustration on how proper design helps to commit marketing, users, management and your own team. Ok, it is focussed on web design, but isn't design one of the most important factors when it comes to gaining commitment? When it looks pretty people automatically think it's good.</p>
