<p>Here's one small time blogger trying to figure out if he should use ad-sense or not. I've tried how it looks, but I find ad-sense ads to disturbing on my blog for my taste. Since I am small time, the money I might make just doesn't seem worth it. Besides I don't have community credit to get away with it, at-least that's what I think.</p>
<p>Concluding on what other people say (<a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/06/why_does_fred_h.html">Seth Godin's</a> & <a href="http://www.petertdavis.net/191-adsense-the-trailer-parks-of-the-web/">Peter T Davis</a>), I think it greatly depends on the kind of site, the community approval of the author and the placement of the ads. Obnoxious ads right in your readers face are not such a good idea especially when you're small time and starting like me.</p>
<p>My choice for now: I won't, perhaps in the future, insights can always change.</p>
