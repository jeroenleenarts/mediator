<p>These two goons were making a dangerous appearance at the NL-Jug J-Spring event. Don't they look tough to you?

<p>Be sure to pay proper respect to these two friendly guys. They're my colleagues, or I'm their colleague. Whatever rocks your boat. Anyway, say "Hi!" to them for me when you meet them.</p>
<p>Thanks for posing for this picture guys. :)</p>
