<p>Allister Smith gives a talk about pragmatic java development. Don't overuse patterns and other design abstraction.</p>
<p>Python and rails is gaining popularity because it is simpler.</p>
<p>Allister shows an example with a sort of back to basics approach with inline SQL and all in java. While interesting, it still is not as simple as python for example.</p>
<p>Python contains the framework to do the work by default.</p>
<p>He makes a case that the framework code is something you build once. And because YOU build it, you are in control. But if you need too much code, do go for an existing framework.</p>
<p>Allister's case goes against all the standard practices in java. I'm not convinced, but it is an interesting subject. Are java developers making they're solutions more complicated then needed. </p>
