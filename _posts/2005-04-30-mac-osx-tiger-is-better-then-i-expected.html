<p>The last few weeks the hype surrounding Tiger's release made me skeptical to say the least. I was expecting some minor updates and a boat load of gadgettesk features. Well those features are indeed there. But the OS itself also had a nice overhaul. In general everything runs a bit smoother and I can't escape the idea that more thought went into how a normal user would perform tasks on the system.</p>
<p>Spotlight is great too... But I can't wonder about the difference in legislation. A certain Redmond based company get all kind of demands based on the fact that it's all integrated. Somehow this doesn't apply to Apple it seems. Seems being a monopolist isn't allways a good thinh... ;)</p>
