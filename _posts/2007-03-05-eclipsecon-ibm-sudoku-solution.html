<p>IBM is sponsoring some event on EclipseCon called the EclipseCon Reception<br />
at tuesday march 6th from 7:30 pm till 9:30 pm. I got this flyer in my<br />
"welcome package" with a sudoku puzzle in it. If you complete this puzzle<br />
you'll win a prize. A electronic sudoku puzzle board. Not something for<br />
me, but hey a goody is a goody and I allready know who I will make happy<br />
with it.</p>
<p>Anyway, why bother solving the puzzle yourself? Now since I am the<br />
ultimate lazy basterd, I ran it through a Sudoku solver. No need to crunch<br />
those numbers myself. Saves me a lot of time. And to save you the trouble<br />
too, here is an ugle table with my result:</p>
<table>

<p>I am guessing that there is only one puzzle. Let me know if there <strong><em>are</em></strong><br />
more. ;)</p>
<p>Oh and, got a nasty jetlag here. It's 4:10 in the middle of the night. :p<br />
Went to bed at 8, so yeah, I've slept about 7:30 hours. I'll try to nap an<br />
hour or so in a bit. But on the other hand, I'm halfway through my jetlag<br />
already. Sudoku solving in the middle of the night, am I losing it? :p</p>
<p><b>Now go get your goodie on tuesday!!</b></p>
