<p>Objective-C is such a funky (dynamic) language.</p>
<p>Like Scott Stevenson showed on his blog in the last few days:</p>
<p><a href="http://theocacao.com/document.page/264">Dynamic Objective-C with NSInvocation</a><br />
<a href="http://theocacao.com/document.page/265">Forwarding NSInvocations in Objective-C</a><br />
<a href="http://theocacao.com/document.page/266">Replacing Objective-C Methods at Runtime</a></p>
<p>Stuff like that makes me think that Java as a language/runtime just sucks sometimes. Sure java's got reflection and funky runtimestuff if you really want too. (As in cooking your own classloader and doing runtime code injection, now that's a cool one.)</p>
<p>But it doesn't come even close to what Objective-C can do. Not to mention what <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> can do. While I'm not into the whole  <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> thing yet (chronic time shortage). It does seem like a hell of a dynamic language. On the other hand, all this dynamic stuff makes me feel wary, feels like a big gun capable of shooting big holes in things. Which can be a good and/or bad. Imagine pointing at your own feet, or better yet, a pointy haired boss.</p>
<p>Also, for those who know <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/">Lisp</a>, it must feel a bit like "Been there, seen it, done that. Anything new today?" Just for the record, I also think <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/">Lisp</a> ownes each and every language out there. Every new feature a language hauls along on "yet another band wagon" is either allready available in <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/">Lisp</a>, or is just around the corner with one or two <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/macros-defining-your-own.html">macro</a>'s.</p>
