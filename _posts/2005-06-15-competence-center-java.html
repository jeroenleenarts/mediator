<p>My employer is setting up a comptence center for Java. All the ussuall stuff you can expect. But the plus side is that I might be able to combine my studies with some work related stuff.</p>
<p>Now only to think up a way to sell it to my employer that any research done for my education will remain under my copyright. It would really suck if I think up something nice and my employer walking away with it taking the credit for it. Perhaps I should GPL it and then give it to my employer, that way I allways remain the owner of the original work and my employer is free do with it what they want under the condition that my name remains attached to any derived works.</p>
