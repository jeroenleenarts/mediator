<p>My last blog post has been 7 days ago already. Now that's not good. I have <a href="http://blog.leenarts.net/2006/06/20/naked-conversations/" title="Naked Conversations post">read a book</a> that states a good blogger should post often.</p>
<p>Fortunatly I have an excuse. Since I was a little kid I always have had these terrible headaches every now and then. My physician diagnosed me with a form of migraine or tension headache. Basicly it involves sound and light sensitivity with a one sided pain in my head. Most of the times it's the left side, but it can be my right side too.</p>
<p>Anyway, it was super fun again last week. Of all 7 days I had headaches on 5 days. With two of them inhibiting my ability to work. As you can guess I have been resting a lot last week.</p>
<p>My trigger apears to be stress. And this can come from the strangest sources. Usually it's actually not directly work related. Like this week. There's a heat wave going on here and the heat is preventing me from getting a good nights sleep. Shortage in sleep causes stress. I am talking about no more then 6 hours of sleep every night for a few days. I get really tired, and when I actually get some rest, 2 days later it's bingo.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have tried these things sofar:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobson%27s_Progressive_Muscle_Relaxation">Jacobson's Progressive Muscle Relaxation</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/medicines/100003625.html">Imigran nasal spray</a></li>
<li>Glasses</li>
<li>Stay active. Usually I sport 2 to 3 times a week at a <a href="http://www.studioperfect.nl/">local gym</a>. In my experience it helps me to sport and stay fit. Plus it helps prevent RSI complaints too. The other kind of muscle tension really can be a relief sometimes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most those have been met with partial succeses. Sometimes it works, but I can't predict if and when. All I know is that the nasal spray made me get a bit loopy at times. That was really weird stuff so I decided to not use that stuff anymore. The glasses, sport and relaxation excersizes have improved my life a lot already when it comes to headaches. But there is still a lot of room for improvement.</p>
<p>My plan when headache strikes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get something to eat before I start to feel sick. It helps me get over the headache when I actually eat something and get to keep it in.</li>
<li>Take a really hot shower. And by hot I mean hot on the edge of painfull.</li>
<li>Lie flat on my belly with the painfull side into the mattress without a pillow.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, you see, I have an excuse for not posting last week. Also, suggestions are always very welcome...</p>
