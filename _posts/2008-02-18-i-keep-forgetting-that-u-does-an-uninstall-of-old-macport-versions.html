<p><img src="/assets/macports-logo-top.png" alt="macports-logo-top.png" border="0" width="183" height="70" align="left" />According to the <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a> port command man page the option -u: "uninstall non-active ports when upgrading and uninstalling".</p>
<p>Just running port upgrade all the time litters your systems with lots and lots op old archived versions of installed ports.</p>
<p>To correct this whole mess you could run "sudo port -u uninstall". This should uinstall any archived versions you might have. You might need to add a -f to that to make it work: "sudo port -uf uninstall".</p>
<p>You might have some trouble when you force a removal like this when one of your installed ports is linked against an older version of a library. This can be fixed by <a href="http://trac.macosforge.org/projects/macports/wiki/ProblemHotlist">replaying some steps on this page</a>.</p>
<p>Basically this post is a reminder for myself. But just maybe someone might find this useful too.</p>
