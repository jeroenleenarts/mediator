<p>It seems <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Oracle-Buys-prnews-14969049.html">Oracle has put forward a bid on SUN Microsystems</a>. Sun apparently has accepted this offer and both parties are now in final negotiations.</p>
<p>Personally I didn't see this one coming. The IBM/Sun brush a short while ago was kind of obvious to me. Still a bit of a surprise, but yeah IBM absorbing SUN I can dig that.</p>
<p>Now Oracle has stepped up to the plate and dumped a load of money on the table. Oracle never has been my favourite when it came to Java related technology. Lots of cool demo's that are hard to reproduce in real life situations if you ask me. Also Oracle doesn't give me that welcoming feeling when getting into contact with them. I guess we'll just have to wait and see how this ordeal is going to affect Java in general.</p>
<p>I see a lot of competition between IBM and Oracle in the future. Because let's just face it, is there any other big Java player to speak of if this deal gets finalised? There just aren't any other vendors that could offer a complete no holds barred JEE stack besides those two big names.</p>
