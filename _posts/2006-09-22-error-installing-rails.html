<p><img id="image97" src="/assets/rails.png" alt="Ruby on Rails project logo" style="float:left; margin: 5px" />Recently I re-installed all my DarwinPorts. This included my Ruby and Rails installs. The first time I ever tried installing Rails I used RubyGems installed by DarwinPorts and it worked without a problem. The second time didn't went so smooth. It appears that the rb-rubygems package of DarwinPorts is FUBAR or something.</p>
<p>For those trying to get Ruby on Rails running on OSX with DarwinPorts/MacPorts: Watch out for this error:</p>

<p>I've ran into this one. The problem? Quite simple to solve. It seems that the DarwinPorts package <code>sudo port install rb-rubygems</code> should not be used anymore according to some people. Installing rails by using the rubygems installed by DarwinPorts messes things up a little. Try <code>sudo port port install rb-rails</code> instead. It worked for me. Only drawback is, you didn't install rails with rubygems and you have to remember to install updates and extra gems by using DarwinPorts.</p>
<p><b>Edit:</b> <a href="http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/">DarwinPorts</a> is now renamed to <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>. An existing DarwinPorts install will transparently update to MacPorts by running "sudo port selfupdate".</p>
