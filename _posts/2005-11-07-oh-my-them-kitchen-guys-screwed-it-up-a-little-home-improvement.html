<p>They forget my water tap...<br />
They forget my stack of drawer face plates...<br />
The finish on one corner beneath a cupboard is not up to my expectation...<br />
But all things into consideration it is turning into a very nifty kitchen...</p>
<p>Yes the insalled it last weeks and it isn't entirely done yet. The tiles need some work.</p>
<p>After that still lods of work todo (painting, painting, some more painting and even more painting...). But the end is near, my budget was gone too, about 2 weeks ago. Ouch... :P But it's going to be workth it. Them radiators are b#tch ugly, the NEED some covering, it turns the entire room around when I do that.</p>
<p>(Jolly, I do have a blog to post to. :P)</p>
