<p>For one of my courses towards my M.Sc. we're using Breeze. First time using Breeze to me. And I must say it works rather well. We're conferencing with 5 people using web-cams.</p>
<p>Sound and images are a bit choppy now and then, but it's a big improvement over using mail and or text chat programs. We're able to talk, gesture, share files, do powerpoint presentations and scratch on a whiteboard together.</p>
