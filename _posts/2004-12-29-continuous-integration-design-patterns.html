<p>As I mentioned in a <a href="http://blog.leenarts.net/2004/12/17/design-patterns-maven-cruisecontrol-java/">previous blog</a> I am doing some work related to Continuous integration in Java. It's nothing fancy, but still people are not doing it because they are unaware of the benefits.</p>
<p>Yesterdag evening I had my first take on the presentation. It's comming together quite nicely, but still I'm in doubt about the ammount of demo versus the ammount of theory. But that'll all come together after a while.</p>
<p>Now for my Msc on the other hand I have to do an assignment about some game called Mankala. It's focussed around the design of this game. It's not my cup of thea and I think that whatever me and my colleague are going to deliver will be an overengineered piece of ehr.... work. You know the drill, a simple application burdened by it's heavy weight enterprise design.</p>
<p>But on the otherhand it's a nice short assignment on which I can brush up aquintance with the gang of four and friends. :)</p>
