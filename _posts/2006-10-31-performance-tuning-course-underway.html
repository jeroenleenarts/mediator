<p>Nice, Kirk Peperdine seems like a very nice guy. Although we&#8217;re only like 4 hours underway I think this will be an interesting course. Also Kirk is doing the entire course. I had my doubts if he would.</p>
<p>More on the contents and my views on the course later. Right now it&#8217;s almost time for lunch. And Kirk is paging his slides quite fast.</p>
