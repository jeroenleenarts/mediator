<p><img src="/assets/nljug.gif" border="0" width="125" height="125" alt="Eclipse University banner." style="margin: 5px; float: left" />Last week I presented at J-Spring 2008. It was one of the first times I presented to such a large group of unknowns. The room wasn't packed, but still quite full. Afterwards I heard the head count was over 70 people attending my session. Good to see that many people interested in ANTLR. I was in the before last round of sessions and not everyone of the 1000 people attending was on the premises anymore. So all in all. I think I did good by at least attracting 10% of those people still there.</p>
<p>My presentation went very smooth. In 45 minutes I crammed 42 slides, 3 short demo's and a 5 minute Q&A.</p>
<p>I did fumble on one single thing.</p>
<p class="important">ANTLR does allow more than 2 nodes with the same root node in a tree.</p>
<p>It's all supported in the tree grammar syntax. The grammar I demoed was indeed binary, I thought the question was about that fact, while in hindsight I realised the person was asking if ANTLR support AST's with more than 2 child nodes on a node.</p>
