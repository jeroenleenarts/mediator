<p>Just a couple of blogs about people stating they actually already are at<br />
EclipseCon 2007. (Not that many.)<br />
Look for more at <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?q=eclipsecon">Google</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/search/eclipsecon">Techorati</a> or your<br />
other favourite blog search tool.</p>
<p>I wonder how many I am going to find tomorrow. :)</p>
<p>I also read about some bloggers evening you could get invited for. Guess I<br />
didn't hang out at the registration area long enough. But I was wasted<br />
anyway. :)</p>
