<p>I've just put some final touches to a presentation and demo I'm giving on <a href="http://www.antlr.org/">ANTLR v3</a>. On april 16th I will be presenting at the Dutch <a href="http://www.nljug.org/pages/events/content/jspring_2008/">NL-JUG J-Spring conference</a>. It's a Dutch conference focussed on all things Java.</p>
<p>Hope to see you there, and if not, my employer is probably going to post my slides very soon <a href="http://www.infosupport.nl/JavaEvents">somewhere linked of of this page</a>.</p>
