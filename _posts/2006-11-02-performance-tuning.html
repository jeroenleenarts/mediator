<p>Just a little update after yesterday. I must say that Kirk is performing a marvellous job. So-far we have touched on subjects like heap tuning, garbage collection tuning, profiling and architecting for performance. Loads and loads of stuff. And we're only half way through! Fortunately the course attendees seem to be a rather bright bunch of people, so Kirk is able to work through the material at a nice tempo. I knew the Java JVM had lots of arguments, but man, in the last two days I learned about boat loads more.</p>
<p>Woops, Kirk is starting again. More on this later.</p>
