<p>I recently got word from the NL-JUG that they have granted me a presentation slot based on my session proposal regarding ANTLR.</p>
<p>I think it will be a tricky session to pull of properly. I'll have to make a guess about how much my audience will know about grammar definition, parsers and compilers. But hey, that challenge is part of the reason I made my session proposal.</p>
<p>More details will follow.</p>
