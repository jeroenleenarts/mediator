<p>My departure time from airport Schiphol (AMS) was scheduled at 11:10. So I<br />
got up early today so I could be at the airport around nine. Having faith<br />
in the Dutch railways turned bad on me today. The first scheduled train<br />
was cancelled because they didn't have a train to run it with. My trip had<br />
not even started and I got half an hour of delay. Good thing I'm<br />
travelling light with only hand luggage. Because I was at the airport at<br />
about 9:38. While it turned out fine, I was a bit nervous. (Not a seasoned<br />
plane traveller here.)</p>
<p>The flight itself was rather boring. Flew with a Mc Douglas M11. So no<br />
personal screen to play with, so watching some movies on the overhead<br />
screens caused me a head twist induced headache. That was a big<br />
disappointment for me. I drooled all over KLMs Boeing 777 last week and<br />
was kind of hoping to try and find the debug option of the personal<br />
entertainment system. Good thing the entertainment system is a separate<br />
system from the rest of the plane though. ;) The downside was the fact<br />
that I had a big headache during most of the flight. But hey, I'm here, my<br />
hotel room is fine.</p>
<p>I got my EclipseCon badge as well today. So I'm hoping to be able to raid<br />
the breakfast table tomorrow while everyone else is standing in line<br />
looking pretty getting their badges.</p>
<p>Now it's munch-munch time followed by nap-nap time. Expect to see more<br />
here as events unfold. :)</p>
