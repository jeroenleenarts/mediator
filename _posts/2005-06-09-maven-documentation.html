<p>Damn, where to start?</p>
<p>In my own enthousiasm I've promised my employer to write a sort of introduction to Maven. Problem is that the maven site has improved a whole lot since the last time I checked.</p>
<p>This means I will be pasting a sh#tload of URL's in the document. But then it won't be that good of a read.</p>
<p>The best part is that most of the work on the document will be done in afterhours. But they pay compensation.</p>
