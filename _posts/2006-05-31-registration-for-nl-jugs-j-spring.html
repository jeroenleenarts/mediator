<p><a href="http://www.nljug.org"><img id="image74" src="/assets/nljug.gif" alt="Dutch Java User Group" style="float: left; margin: 5px" /></a> Well, last night I registered for the <a href="http://www.nljug.org">NL-JUG</a>'s J-Spring. So those who want to come to the NL-JUG's J-Spring too should start <a href="http://www.nljug.org/jspring/registration/">registering</a> soon!</p>
<p>Let me know if you are planning to attend, perhaps we can have a drink/talk @ J-Spring. And yes, I'm an official member of the NL-JUG too. :D</p>
