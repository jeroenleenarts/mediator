<p>Nico van Hanxleden Houwert gives a talk about solving constrain satisfaction problems. Problems like 10 ships need to dock at 5 docking slots. How to plan this considering parameters like ship and dock size. Real life examples can contain millions of examples. Which solution is the best under the set constraint.</p>
<p>It is a problem domain with a logarithmic or quadratic increase in size when parameters increase. Doubling the number of ships and docks can make easily make problems insolvable in a reasonable time constraint.</p>
<p>Lots of talk about a problem he wants to solve. Bit of basic set theory, not much java code. </p>
<p>Java offers frameworks to facilitate solving such problems. ILOG and Cream are examples of java frameworks suitable for constraint satisfaction discovery.</p>
<p>Fun subject. But get a book, read an article: you'll know more in less time.    </p>
