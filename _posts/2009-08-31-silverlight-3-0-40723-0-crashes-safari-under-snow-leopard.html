<p>This is the first big issue i've seen with Snow Leopard so far.</p>
<p>Nothing to bad for me for now, but I discovered this while loading the intranet site at my work. The welcome page contains a Silverlight applet. Removing Silverlight from my internet pluging folder resolved the issue.</p>
<p>I'm guessing Microsoft will have a solution for this pretty soon.</p>
