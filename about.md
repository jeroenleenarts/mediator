I’m Jeroen a dutch software developer employed by a consulting company. Mostly I write Java code. But since 2005 I have grown an interest in OSX development. I won’t go into the tiniest details of software development. Most likely I’ll post my personal views about my work and life as a software developer.

Here is a link to my [GPG public key](/public.gpg).
